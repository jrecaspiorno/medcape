Ejemplo: P8_3 = GPIO1[6] = GPIO1_6 = GPIO38 porque (38=1*32+6)

Explicación:
Find out which GPIO corresponds to which pin.

The AM335x has four built-in GPIO controllers, named gpio0[], gpio1[], gpio2[] 
and gpio3[]. For each controller, there is one page of memory which controls each 
gpio controller. Each controller is responsible for 32 GPIOs. Each 32bit word has
 a specific function. Like pin configuration, controlling or setting a specific 
pin-state. Each bit in each of these words controls a GPIO pin.

Choose function by choosing the word, choose GPIO by choosing the bit. This is basically what the 
Linux Kernel does for you, when you use the SysFS interface. This is also how the 
different GPIOs are numbered in Linux. Linux gpio/gpi0/ is gpio0[0] (bit 0 on gpio
 chip 0), Linux gpio/gpio1/ is bit1 on chip 0 and so on, till we get to 
Linux gpio/gpio32/ which is bit0 on chip1 (gpio1[0]).

So, when you now take a look at Table 12 and 13 of the BeagleBoneBlack SRM and
 read that e.g. Pin P8_3 on the expansion header is routed to gpio1[6] inside
 the chip, it's easy to calculate that in Linux you see this as gpio/gpio38/ 
since 38=1*32+6.
