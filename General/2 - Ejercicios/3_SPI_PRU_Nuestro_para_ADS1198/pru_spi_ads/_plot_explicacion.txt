ADS's format: Unsigned ints(32 bits), little endian.
		8 channels(1 channel = 24 bits)
[1 channel = 24 bits]

Our data's format: lines of 6 hex characters (2 hex characters = 1 bytes(8 bits)
So...1 channel(24 bits) = 6 hex characters (in case it would be 32 bits each
channel(because 1 unsigned int = 32 bits), it would be 8 hex characters each
channel.

[1st line and 1st character of 2nd line = status bits]

[1 sample = 6 lines]
[1 sample = 18 bytes]
[1 line = 6 hex characters(= 1 channel)(= 3 bytes)]
[1 channel = 6 hex characters]
[1 hex character = 4 bits]
